# About Me

## Introduction
Hi, I am Varsan Jeyakkumar. I am an aspring electrical engineer at the University of Toronto who has been a lifelong STEM person. From robotics to circuit design to programming, I have discovered a passion in the field from my experience and education. I started programming when I was 12, learning Python at home in the middle of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Since then, I have advanced my skills through curriculum, projects, and certifications. One of my early projects was Parrot (see below), a Discord Bot programmed using discord.py with utility, moderative, and administrative functions. This project was deployed in over 100 servers and was published on top.gg, a major Discord bot lookup portal. Since then, I have immersed myself in more languages and gained skills from algorithms to polymorphism to abstract data types.
